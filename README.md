# Discord-Webhook-IP-Logger
This is a IP logger I made that sends the IP of the visitor of a website to Discord as an embed message.<br><br>
<sub>Note 28-03-2022: I think I am going to create a more detailed setup guide soon. (If I don't forget to)</sub><br>
<sub>Note 04-08-2022: I might have forgotten to create a more detailed tutorial. BUT I will make an updated version of this project, so stay tuned!</sub><br>
<sub>Note 15-12-2022: Just continued working on the updated version</sub><br>

# Features
- Grabs the IP of all page visitors (except for bots/crawlers).
- Gets some basic information about the visitor's IP and browser.
- Checks if the IP is a VPN (Not always 100% correct).
- Gets the Geo Location of the visitor and also gives a Google Maps link.

# The Setup
Step 1: Go into the settings of your Discord server, where you want the embeds to come through.<br>
Step 2: Click the 'Webhooks' tab and create a webhook for the channel of choice.<br>
Step 3: After the webhook is created, copy the webhook link.<br>
Step 4: Set the webhook url in [Discord.js](Discord.js) to the one you just copied.<br>
Step 5: Copy the code of the index.html and paste is somewhere in your code.<br>
The code will automatically run when the page loads.
### Enjoy!
